# TCS_intern-Time Series Forecasting System Project 

The project aims to design and implement a robust Forecasting System that accurately predicts product demand using historical data analysis. By leveraging advanced forecasting models, it provides reliable insights into demand patterns, supporting strategic decision-making, optimizing inventory management, and enhancing operational efficiency in a dynamic business environment.

For this project, the dataset was sourced from the Kaggle Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge, comprising 913,000 rows organized into four crucial columnsâ€”Date, Store, Item, and Sales. This dataset represents a comprehensive repository of historical sales data. The dataset is described as follows :

- Date: Sales date without holiday effects or store closures.
-	Store: Store ID, providing a unique identifier for each store.
-	Item: Product ID, offering a distinct identification number for each product.
-	Sales: Quantity of products sold, indicating the number of products sold from a specific store on a specific date.

## Data Analysis Summary :

- After cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted on historical sales data to identify trends, patterns, and seasonality. 
- Key steps included calculating descriptive statistics, performing correlation analysis to understand relationships with external factors, and decomposing the time series to reveal trend and seasonality.
- Data visualization techniques such as time series, seasonal, and distribution plots helped uncover patterns, anomalies, and sales distribution characteristics.
  
These insights provided essential guidance for selecting the appropriate forecasting models.
