## Data Analysis Summary :

- After cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted on historical sales data to identify trends, patterns, and seasonality. 
- Key steps included calculating descriptive statistics, performing correlation analysis to understand relationships with external factors, and decomposing the time series to reveal trend and seasonality.
- Data visualization techniques such as time series, seasonal, and distribution plots helped uncover patterns, anomalies, and sales distribution characteristics.
These insights provided essential guidance for selecting the appropriate forecasting models.
